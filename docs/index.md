### Our Projects: Conveying NON-VERBAL information to your  player

|                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1.   Physical way finding                                    |
| Create a level in which the player will  find their way to the end of the space and then manage to navigate back to  the beginning. |
| The player sees the same objects, just  coming from the opposite direction. |
|                                                              |
| 2. Immersion into the world                                  |
| Something that happened to the  protagonist of the game in the past. |
| Something that happened to a character  who is somehow related to the protagonist (for instance: a sibling, friend,  enemy, or rival). |
| Something about the world in which the  game takes place.    |
|                                                              |
| 3. Design a level around a single type of  puzzle. This must accomplish 2 things:     It must first teach a new mechanic to the player. |
| (If you use a common mechanic like jumping  or shooting, add some novel twist to it!) |
| After teaching the mechanic, the level  must contain at least two puzzles that rely on understanding of the mechanic  to progress. |
|                                                              |
| 4. Your choice                                               |
