### Turn in your work

1) Turn in all your homework as part of your DevLog in this Google Folder: [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mZF34rJRLyvDaWPvpbrqLx2YQPJGt3Sd?usp=share_link)

2) Your final GDD will be turned in as stand alone doccument(s) in a folder inside the one above.

3) Unity Projects will be turned in on Itch.io.  (WegGL, Mac, PC builds. I can help you)



### Our Projects: Conveying NON-VERBAL information to your  player

|                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1.   Physical way finding                                    |
| Create a level in which the player will  find their way to the end of the space and then manage to navigate back to  the beginning. |
| The player sees the same objects, just  coming from the opposite direction. |
|                                                              |
| 2. Immersion into the world                                  |
| Something that happened to the  protagonist of the game in the past. |
| Something that happened to a character  who is somehow related to the protagonist (for instance: a sibling, friend,  enemy, or rival). |
| Something about the world in which the  game takes place.    |
|                                                              |
| 3. Design a level around a single type of  puzzle. This must accomplish 2 things:     It must first teach a new mechanic to the player. |
| (If you use a common mechanic like jumping  or shooting, add some novel twist to it!) |
| After teaching the mechanic, the level  must contain at least two puzzles that rely on understanding of the mechanic  to progress. |
|                                                              |
| 4. Your choice                                               |

- [Doug Church describing why we need Design Tools](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/formal-abstract-design-tools) (Spoiler: to make more unique games)!
- [Katharine Neil speaking at GDC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPtLNkVPWY) about the design tools that would push game design forward. She says game design tools should “support thinking. So your broken, ambiguous and even outright contradictory ideas that you have in your unfinished design … are tolerated and supported “ Katherine Neil game example: [Astrologaster](https://store.steampowered.com/app/742520/Astrologaster/).
