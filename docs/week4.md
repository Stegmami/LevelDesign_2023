# Week 4

- [ ] Review level layout and planning
- [ ] Layout methodologies: Blockouts and greyboxing

# Pre-production Share Session (40 minutes)

Break into small groups (max 4 people) to share & discuss the level concepts & floorplans you developed for homework. 

_You do not need to discuss every parti and bubble diagram you made, just focus on where you ended up._

# Level Layout: Blocking out & Greyboxing

## Blockouts & Greyboxes

A _blockout_ or _greybox_ is a rough draft of a level built quickly using simple shapes and without refined art assets.

These two terms come from 3D level design but their concepts and utility are certainly applicable to 2D games as well.

Fundamentally, they are tools for experimentation and design implementation.
