# Homework

## Prototype 3.

| Design a level around a single type of puzzle. This must accomplish 2 things: It must first teach a new mechanic to the player. |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| (If you use a common mechanic like jumping or shooting, add some novel twist to it!) |
| After teaching the mechanic, the level must contain at least two puzzles that rely on understanding of the mechanic to progress. |
|                                                              |

Teaching a new mechanic, without giving written explanation.   

Deliverables:  We will do rapid fire iteraton in Unity for this project.  

		1) GDD: Player Experience Goal/Mechanic/Assessment
		2) Some kind of paper diagram that you use to design your mechanic and your puzzles
		3) Unity project (On itch.io). 
		4) Playtesting data and conclusions.
		5) ALL FOUR WILL BE TURNED IN WEEKLY.  I WANT TO SEE ITERATION!!!!!

ITERATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
