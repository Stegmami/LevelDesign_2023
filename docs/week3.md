INSPIRATION

[Here is a webpage that might help you think of ideas.  It incliudes brainstorming, etc... it is for Puzzle levels, but the process of creation is same: Brainstorm, try things out....](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/designing-video-game-puzzles)

## Affordances

Affordances are the relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used. It's an incredibly useful way of framing meaningful interaction and design.

[This week's notes on affordances can be found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cM6gRu3UiIJLMzR46rIrY0r0jVLIOhQw-GLGxIUmcEI/edit?usp=sharing)

## Layout

_Layout_ refers to a level's overall structure. Laying out a level might include the following phases:

1. Pre-production
2. Parti diagramming
3. Bubble diagramming
4. Floor plan development
5. Markup
