# Week 5 Playtesting and your last week of       Project 1: The Wayfinding

- [ ] Everyone meets with me individually, to discuss what you are turning in, issues in UnityC#, and you level designs.
- [ ] Play some game on Steam

## Playtesting Tips

Information you can get from player:

	1. What they do.  You can see what they click on, where they try to move their player, etcl.  You must watch them or have some way to record their movement (screen capture or analytics capturing).  Because you are watching them, you want your checkoff system to be EASY.  I like paper.  
	1. What they think.  Ask players to talk their thoughts out loud. This is your way to find out what they call your character, dio they call the hills mountains, etc.
	1. Try acting like you aren't the game developer/designer.  To get more honest reactions. 
	1. Follow up questions.  If you really need them, try this method.   

### Be prepared

- Have a check list of thing you are looking for so you can check fast while still watching player!
- Have controls, title screen, anything else ON PAPER next to your computer.  You wanna test Wayfinding. 

### Don't explain anything

This is really difficult to do, but planning ahead of time and frequently playtesting can help it feel less awkward. Instead...

### Observe!

Watch your playtesters:

- Provide instructions and guidance upfront. Key things should not be a mystery! 
- If you're explaining or guiding a player it means something isn't clear or isn't working.
- Don't distract your playtesters with conversation.
- Don't interfere.

### Take notes

Make sure that you are taking notes throughout the playtest:

- What do you observe? What is a player's behavior? What do they say? What things didn't they understand?
- Keep track of time (How long did it take to play?)
- Follow-up after playtest on notable things you observe
- You might find it helpful to record play sessions to review later

### Post-Playtest Interview

Have a small number of questions to ask your playtesters after they finish. If necessary, ask additional questions based on what you observed.

- Prepare your questions beforehand
- Don't overwhelm your playtesters
- **Don't be defensive**
- **Don't explain**
- Write down player's answers and say "Thank you!" and smile.  This will get you more feedback!



After you have collected your data, add it up, organize it, make some conclusions.  You may find that you were asking the wrong questions.  What statement can you make with the data you have?

### Evaluate your playtest

Don't forget to assess your playtest and determine how to move forward:

- What was successful and how can you amplify this?
- What can you actually fix?
- What should be removed because it doen't work and can't be fixed?
