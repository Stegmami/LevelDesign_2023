# Week 12 

Review what we learned from Playtesting last week.  

- [ ] Please put all your Project 2 deliverables and your playtesting data and report **in your devlog**.
- [ ]  Also in your devlog: **link to your project on Itch.io**  
- [ ] On Itch, please put a **PC downloadable version**. 



New topic!  [This week's notes on puzzles can be found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eAyKph0SPId6twQ8sl2mqr9YgVyOAahsvfUqWEY4zA4/edit?usp=sharing)

PUZZLES!   How do yu teach your player how to solve a puzzle.  ANd if you want your game to be UNIQUE, then you wanna use design thinking!  

In the notes on puzzles, find the chart of puzzle types!  

Emily Short, a leading narrative designer, [developed a taxonomy of puzzles based on interactive fiction](https://emshort.blog/how-to-play/reading-if/puzzles/), which tends to be very puzzle-heavy. Her categories might be better considered as aspects of puzzles, as often puzzles in games tend to blend multiple categories.

These can also be rephrased as:

- The player needs to ______, but ______ blocks their progress.





## HOMEWORK: Project 3!  Work in teams of two!

| Design a level around a single type of puzzle. This must accomplish 2 things: It must first teach a new mechanic to the player. |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| (If you use a common mechanic like jumping or shooting, add some novel twist to it!) |
| After teaching the mechanic, the level must contain at least two puzzles that rely on understanding of the mechanic to progress. |
|                                                              |

Teaching a new mechanic, without giving written explanation.   

Deliverables:  We will do rapid fire iteraton in Unity for this project.  

		1) GDD: Player Experience Goal/Mechanic/Assessment
		2) Some kind of paper diagram that you use to design your mechanic and your puzzles
		3) Unity project (On itch.io). 
		4) Playtesting data and conclusions.
		5) ALL FOUR WILL BE TURNED IN WEEKLY.  I WANT TO SEE ITERATION!!!!!

ITERATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
