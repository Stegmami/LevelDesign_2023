# WHAT IS A LEVEL ? ?
So excited to welcome you all back. Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- What is a level? and other working definitions

## What is a level?
- Notes about history of levels [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Leji7OVc_9DuYgsPoSwm7uGeZD8W0wSBjvyeK6waoUg/edit?usp=sharing)

- In these notes as well are some ideas about how size and color of your surroundings, how we draw the characters, and how that can affect the player/reader.

  

## What is a Game Design Document?

- a Game Design Documemnt (GDD) is a Representation of Your Game. You can see the whole thing, see whether it is balanced, whether it is too long, too much information, etc. just by looking at the GDD.
- My suggestion to you is to follow my GDD templates.  [Basic GDD Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hkeD6JVERprsUQ6_DjPkjXYH67kowzMvlsXDGJt3wIE/edit?usp=sharing).  I created this template to demonstrate how you can see what you are missing just by making the GDD.
- Consider the Experience you intend for you player, the Mechanics/Assets you will use and how you will Assess whether you have succeeded
- I used Storyboarding Method: Beginning/Middle/End.  Inventory of your Player's Perspective at the Beginning/Middle/End of the game.  Then, consider the player's perspective at the Beginning, Middle and End of the Beginning.
- Here is a link to a [Fancy Template for our Beginning/Middle/End perspective taking GDD](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xv30I1VhMmRZYJ5PPiHIJ78d1gW7haCY/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=102518298898107497590&rtpof=true&sd=true)

 

## Level Construction Kit (Getting started building something in Unity)
You may want to make yourself a kit. As preparation for your level design work, build yourself a level construction set. 

1.  A character with animations and controller script
    - Your player must be able to MOVE. *It's up to you to decide how!*
    - Your player character must have one action (a verb!) through which they can interact with enemies. For instance, it could SHOOT them, REPEL them a limited number of times, or BECOME INTANGIBLE temporarily.
    - Make this a prefab.
    - **You can rely on some of [these scripts](https://github.com/samsheffield/2D_Game_Design/tree/Fall_21/Standalone%20Scripts) if you want to work in 2D**
2. Two distinct Sources of Conflict (like enemies) with animations and behavior scripts
    - Make these into prefabs
    - These *Sources of Conflict* must have distinct behaviors, not just variations.
3. One collectible prefab (like a coin) with script to handle players *collecting* them.
    - Make this a prefab
4. Four obstacle placeholder graphics (like a wall). *Sprites for 2D, Materials for 3D*
5. For space placeholder graphics (like a floor). *Sprites for 2D, Materials for 3D*
6. One goal item prefab with script that can be *triggered* by the player
7. A special prefab that is one of the above, but modified with an adjective of your choosing. Examples:
    - A *false* goal
    - A *breakable* obstacle
    - A *friendly* source of conflict

### Some Guidance
These don't need to be the most interesting or precious combinations of things. They just need to be a starting point for us to do some work together. The more you view them as placeholders, the easier it will be to update/change/replace them as needed. But also don't make them so generic that you can't develop some meaningful relationships between them. *You're really threading a needle with this one!*
