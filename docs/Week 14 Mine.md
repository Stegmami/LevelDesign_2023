# Playtesting Prototype 3 and Iterating
You are teaching a new mechanic
- Show it to me (I will meet with each of you individually this morning)
- Prepare for Playtesting
  - polish up what you need to test
  - what data will you collect
    - Metrics: What does you player need to do to be successful with your new mechanic?
    - Observation
      - Ask player to speak their thoughts
      - What do they try to do/expect to do that you did not account for

- Lunch is 12-1 today and we will listen to the speaker, Piero Macgowan, during that time!  
- IF YOU WANT, we can order pizza together: https://viccino.com/pizza/.  
- From 1-2 we planned to get some external playtesting...
- at 2pm is portfolio review by the speaker, Piero Macgowan.

# Homework

### **Today:** You should be deciding what clues your player needs.  You are playtesting 3 versions: three amounts of clues: Easy, Medium and Hard.

### **For next week:** Use what you find out in playtesting today and create a <u>playable prototype</u>.

The assignment:

| Design a level around a single type of puzzle. This must accomplish 2 things: It must first teach a new mechanic to the player. |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| (If you use a common mechanic like jumping or shooting, add some novel twist to it!) |
| After teaching the mechanic, the level must contain at least two puzzles that rely on understanding of the mechanic to progress. |
|                                                              |

Teaching a new mechanic, without giving written explanation.   

Deliverables:  We will do rapid fire iteraton in Unity for this project.  

		1) GDD: Player Experience Goal/Mechanic/Assessment
		2) Some kind of paper diagram that you use to design your mechanic and your puzzles
		3) Unity project (On itch.io). 
		4) Playtesting data and conclusions.
		5) ALL FOUR WILL BE TURNED IN WEEKLY.  I WANT TO SEE ITERATION!!!!!

ITERATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
