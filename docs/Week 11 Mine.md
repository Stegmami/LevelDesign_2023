## Week 11 in Level Design

Playtesting day!

Remember, we just want to get some perspective from a stranger.  We are not trying to impress anyone with our brilliance as gamedevs.  Not today!  Today we just ask, "What do you think is happening here?"

### **Project 2 Deliverable for 03/29. This will be graded!  

- Link to your project in Itch.io
- Instructions, controls, and list of known bugs in the description in Itch.io.
- Game design documents
  - Grey boxing or Bubble diagram with an indication of where things happen
  - Game Design document: Facts are your Player Experience goal
  - UX20: User Experience Written out method



New deliverables that are about playtesting.  This isn't exactly graded, but please learn it because it will be a big part of Project 3 and it will be very helpful for your career as game designers.  This is "User Experience Research." 

- Play testing douments

  - What statements are you trying to prove?  

- - What data will you collect?

- 

- *Types of playtesting data:

- 1. Questions prior to playing
  2. Observing the player while they play (you must write your notes before the next player starts.
  3. Asking the player to “think out loud” while they play.
  4. Collecting metrics during game play (you note them by hand while watching or they can be counted and saved by your game).
  5. Follow up questions.

- A lovely and nicely detailed practical guide to collecting good data in playtesting sessions. Read this chapter (9 short pages). [RichardLemarcha_2021_25RunningAFormalPlayt_APlayfulProductionPro.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CT8v_tW8fwzXfoSdcHqLrPSawhMsdTV8/view?usp=share_link)

  

  ## HOMEWORK: Project 3!  Work in teams of two!

  

  | 3. Design a level around a single type of puzzle. This must accomplish 2 things: It must first teach a new mechanic to the player. |
  | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | (If you use a common mechanic like jumping or shooting, add some novel twist to it!) |
  | After teaching the mechanic, the level must contain at least two puzzles that rely on understanding of the mechanic to progress. |
  |                                                              |

Teaching a new mechanic, without giving written explanation.   

Deliverables:  We will do rapid fire iteraton in Unity for this project.  

		1) GDD: Player Experience Goal/Mechanic/Assessment
		2) Some kind of paper diagram that you use to design your mechanic and your puzzles
		3) Unity project (On itch.io). 
		4) Playtesting data and conclusions.
		5) ALL FOUR WILL BE TURNED IN WEEKLY.  I WANT TO SEE ITERATION!!!!!

ITERATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
