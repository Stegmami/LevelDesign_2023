## Week 9 March 22, 2023

We talked about the games we played over spring break
		Jonn showed us three games (even brought his WiU in!) with neat level designs to discuss:
								Cooperative game play of Mario 3D World: three players all jump on a dino and then all 3 players together steer and jump the dino in a river.  It is a new gameplay experience, encouraging the players to talk to gether other.
								Information driven Navigation in _____Paper Mario Color Spash: Knowing you need to accomplish a task in level 1 but not having tool yet encourages you to look back at level 1 when you get new tools.  
								Wooly World taught new mechanics like Pulling Yarn to destroy enemies, and also shooting yarn at empty platform frame to fill them up with yarn so you can jump on them.  A nice example of combining the familiar with a new mechanics to make the player feel clever.

​		Marisa talked about Disco Elysium: Storytelling in an open world format: the player can move and discover information in different order, the environment tells a story and after moving through a room/area an NPC talks to you and gives you a story consistent with what you saw in the environment. Storytelling with two methods.   Letting player learn for themselves makes it feel more immersive.  

​		Barbara talked about Neon White: Pathfinding, shortcuts: players can tell where to go quickly because of how the world is drawn, and then competition for speed encourages people to look for shortcuts. The graphic novel aspect of the game deepens the experience/keeps player involved. 

​	Miranda talked about the Sims a bit and then also about _______ (Miranda, what other game did you mention?)

  Silvia talked about a game that was very interesting but I have forgotten the details!  Silvoa, please remind me!!

Cat talked about a narrative game (what was the name?)  that relied on the player's knowledge of how Asian parents are more likely to believe in evil spirits that to listen to their children asking for help.  Silvia agreed with Cat about many parts of the game that Asian players would understand.   

Who is the target audience for these games?  Why do these players play them?  Are the Asian parents going to play?  Why do the Asian players want to play a game like this?Marisa suggested that **catharsis**!  Cat's game and Disco Elysium both provide catharsis to the player.   

We discussed the games and how the genra and the understood rules of the game, the art style, story style are so exciting and engaging for us.  We also talked about how culture and myth play a part of making the experience engaging.  

A more intricate experience is more engaging for our players.  Players want to be engaged in a worthy problem.  Players want to feel clever!  Making our player feel clever means the problems need to seem hard enough to be worth solving and the player also needs to feel capable of soving them.  Today we decided that we can create complex interesting games for our target audience by using 

1) game mechanics they are familiar with
1) Stories/myth/culture they are familiar with
1) ading a new twist to the story or a challenge on top of the familiar game mechanics

This way, the whole game is complex and the player needs to draw on their knowledge to succeed, but the only really new part is 3. the new twist/new mechanic.  



## HOMEWORK due Wednesday March 29:

**ONE:**  You will all have a testable Unity project.   Make a WebGL on Itch.io.  Remmeber you need to make someting that lets you test whether your environmental stprytelling is working, not a whole game!  Just enough that you can do THREE below.	

**TWO:** [Read this book chapter on playtesting!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CT8v_tW8fwzXfoSdcHqLrPSawhMsdTV8/view?usp=share_link)   This is from Richard Lemarchand's book, A Playful Production Process.  I highly recommend it!

We will meet in Game Lab for the morning.  From 9 - 11 We will <u>prepare for playtesting</u>.  
					What facts are you testing for? 
					What data will you collect?
							Before, during, after they play?
							Questions with a scale 1-5 to answer, 
							Observations you make and notes you take

**THREE:**  <u>To be prepared for playtesting</u>, I want you to have a plan to collect 2 peices of data for each conclusion you make.  For example, if you want to say "My players understand that the cat is theirs." give me two kinds of data that prove this.  
I want you to choose a few statements you want to prove.  Obviously, I want you to fous on whether your players are understanding your environmental storytelling!		

**FOUR:**  After lunch, noon - 2 we will met in the Classroom in the library.  Half of us will set up to playtest and the other half of us will attract playtesters and bring them back to the library.

Your homework after that will be to analyze your data.  (And get started on our third project.)
