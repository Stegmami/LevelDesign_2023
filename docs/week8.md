## Playtesting

What did you discover while watching people play?
What changes would you make to your level?
How could you have avoided issues?
					How could you have tested earlier?  What small bit of your level could you have developed to test?
					What diagram might have helped?  Would it have helped if you had iterated on your diagram more?
What woudl you do next if you had another week to work?  



## Wayfinding

_Wayfinding_ refers to a process a player uses to find where they are, or where they are going.

## Environmental Storytelling

_Environmental storytelling_ is an approach to narrative in levels that leverages a space and the objects contained within it. It asks the question, “what happened here?”

## Prototype 2: Narrative Level (Due 04/05)

Using your level design construction kit, build a single level which communicates these 3 specific facts to your player:
1. Something that happened to the protagonist of the game in the past.

2. Something that happened to a character who is somehow related to the protagonist (for instance: a sibling, friend, enemy, or rival).

3. Something about the world in which the game takes place.

__You are encouraged to work in self-selected pairs for this prototype.__

## After lunch

### Work session Begin brainstorming and partner finding
Your brainstorming goals for tonight:
- What's your level's overall concept?
- What are your 3 facts?
- What diagrams will help you?
- Draft some very drafty GDD, UX text, Bubble diagram, Grey Box/Blocking...  Think with your pens

# Homework

## Brainstorming documentation
Make sure your DevLog contains your brainstorming drafts and 3 the facts your player will discober by the end of class.

For next week:

### **Week 2 Goals (03/01)**

**Pre-production goals:**

- What are your player experience goals for your level?
- What is the pillar (central player experience goal) for your level?
- What else do you want in your level?

**Layout goals:**

- Develop 6 parti thumbnails/sketches (quick ideas)
- Develop 3 bubble diagrams based on the partis you find most interesting
- Develop a floor plan based on your most promising bubble diagram with details on encounters, mechanics, important game objects, and your level’s critical path
