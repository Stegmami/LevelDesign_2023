## Expectations we will share in this class

Three projects and one bonus project. In Unity: not polished nor finished art-wise but just enough to demonstrate that your level design plan is working.  It is most important that you respond to playtesting data in your design docs and Unity projects.

DevLog [Here is a template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CDWP6xeKgvqE7Z0IDmKYJgE2VyMOTsafTvgbygd6M2E/edit?usp=sharing) Make a copy, name it YourLastName_DevLog_23_0118, share it with me. This one long doc will contain your class notes, game design documentation, task list, work session notes, notes on readings and writing for homework.

Game Design diagrams, spreadsheets, tables, and other game design tools (see the readings below).

# Some Introductory Readings
- [Some history of Level Design: A short chapter from The Level Design Book, a very specific overview of early computer game level design.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/115gzN18dupkvFe-tCarKzo67QzIL33le/view?usp=sharing)
- [Doug Church describing why we need Design Tools](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/formal-abstract-design-tools) (Spoiler: to make more unique games)!
- [Katharine Neil speaking at GDC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPtLNkVPWY) about the design tools that would push game design forward. She says game design tools should "support thinking.  So your broken, ambiguous and even outright contradictory ideas that you have in your unfinished design ... are tolerated and supported "  Katherine Neil game example: [Astrologaster](https://store.steampowered.com/app/742520/Astrologaster/) .

# Textbooks

I found these books very useful and inspiring. They are worth your money.

# Homework

##### Part A. In class.  Today in the GameLab, we will play games!

​	Make sure you <b>play all three games:</b><b><br>
​            Flow (On the Play Station 3 in the GameLab)<br>
​            [Immune Defense](https://melanieanns.itch.io/)    MelanieAnnS.itch.io  Install it on any PC.  Is on the GameLab PC!<br>
​			[Everything Is Going to Be OK](https://alienmelon.itch.io/)   Alienmelon.itch.io.  Is on the PC in GameLab

Answer one of the following

1) Choose one of the games and create a diagram you think would be useful for designing novel levels in this game. Describe what you think the User Experience goals were for the project, who is the audience? How does this game convey information to the player? How does the player know what to do?
2) Compare two of the games. How do they convey information? Which game compels you to play longer? Why? Can you engage a player as effectively with no instructions? How does failing help the player learn? How does each game handle failure? 
3) What would you do to improve one of these games?  When you watch other people play the game, what do you notice?

##### Part B Do All of These:

1. Think about what kinds of level design you are interested in. Consider what kind of diagrams, spreadsheets or other gane design tools you would like to use to design the game levels you imagine.
2. Read this to prepare for our discussion in class next week. We will be focusing on creating a space and allowing our player to navigate through it. [Emilia Schatz lead game designer at Naughty Dog](https://80.lv/articles/defining-environment-language-for-video-games/)
3. Choose a game that is similar to one you might like to make, and <b>play it</b>.  Be ready to talk about it next week.


Part A and B Due in class next week.  Put it all into your DevLog document, unless you make a diagram, you can make a separate doc for diagrams if you want to. 

# Remember

Work in short, frequent sessions.  Three 2-hour sessions Wed, Fri, Tues, for example. Write your tasks down in your DevLog. So you always know what to do before you start. At end of each work session, update your task list.
